# Final Project of Digital Laboratory
## Project Requirement
* Required to use FPGA to develop any topics.
* Form a group with two people.
## Project Abstract
*	Designed an aircraft shooting game with Verilog on the FPGA (Digilent Nexys4 DDR).
*	Utilized IP catalog of FPGA to input images and display objects, background and UI on screen by VGA output.

### Outline of The project
* We could use buttons on FPGA to control aircraft movement and attack.
* There are two stages in the game. 
  * First stage is equipped with two minions with horizon movement, vertical attack and 50 health points.
  * The second stage is equipped with one boss with randomized movement, two attacking modes and 200 health points.
* The Gaming Flow Chart:
