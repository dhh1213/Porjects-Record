# Final Project for ICLAB
Due to confidential reasons, didn't upload all files to this site.
## Project Description
In this project, we were going to implement a ToF chip. The goal is to calculate how
many cycles have passed from the laser (start) to the sensor (stop), calculate the distance
of the object, and store it in DRAM.

## Main Features
* Usage of SRAM and DRAM
* Algorithm for calculating ToF
* FSM, sequential circuit and pipeline
* APR Flow

The whole projects include Verilog code designing and running through APR flow.
