# ECE408 Final Project for 2021 Fall
This is the personal record for UIUC Fall 2021 ECE408 course project.

In this final project, I was implementing and optimizing the forward-pass of a convolutional layer using CUDA. 

The overall learning objectives for this project are:
* Demonstrating command of CUDA and optimization approaches by designing and implementing an optimized neural-network
 convolutional layer forward pass
* Obtaining practical experience in analyzing and fine tuning CUDA kernels through the use of profiling tools like Nsight Systems (```nsys```) 
 and Nsight-Compute (```nv-nsight-cu```)

The project including three parts:
* Milestone 1: Rai Installation, CPU convolution, Profiling
* Milestone 2: Baseline Convolutional Kernel
* Milestone 3: GPU Convolution Kernel Optimizations
